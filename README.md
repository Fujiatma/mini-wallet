# Project Scope
This Project is handle the all requirements below:
- The user token implemented with JWT.
- When a user initiates, it will automatically create customer data and wallet data.
- Before enabling the wallet, the customer cannot view, add, or use its virtual money.
- If the wallet is already enabled, this endpoint would fail. This endpint should be usable again only if the wallet is disabled.
- The user can make a deposit to add balance to the wallet.
- The user can also make a withdrawal to withdraw balance from the wallet.
- Every deposit or withdrawal transaction will be recorded in the transaction table.
- The user can view all transactions.
- After adding or using virtual money, it is not expected to have the balance immediately updated. The maximum delay for updating the balance is 5 seconds. (with goroutine)
